ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCENTIVES OF APPOINTED AND

ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICIALS

Zohal Hessami*

Abstract—Political agency models suggest that elected public ofﬁcials
choose different policies than appointed ofﬁcials do. This paper is the ﬁrst
(a) to apply a clean empirical design to study whether the selection rule has
a causal effect on public ofﬁcials’ policy choices and (b) to investigate trans-
mission channels. I exploit a unique setting in Germany, where a reform has
created quasi-experimental variation in the selection rule for mayors. As the
outcome variable, I use data on grant receipts for highly visible investment
projects for which mayors must apply to the state government. Elected may-
ors attract 7% to 7.4% more grants in election years; for appointed mayors,
there is no cycle. Using hand-collected data on mayor characteristics, I ﬁnd
suggestive evidence that although the selection of mayors changes follow-
ing the reform studied, a likely reason for the observed cycle is that elected
mayors have stronger electoral incentives.

Introduction

Acentral question in political economy is how to select

public ofﬁcials. Public ofﬁcials may be appointed by
an elected body, such as a legislature, or directly elected
by voters. The way in which public ofﬁcials are selected
is likely to affect policy choices for two reasons. Based on
political agency models, it is plausible that elected public
ofﬁcials face stronger incentives to perform well in ofﬁce
and have characteristics that make them more appealing to
voters than appointed public ofﬁcials (Besley, 2006; Persson
& Tabellini, 2000).1 This is the ﬁrst study to explore whether
there is a causal effect of the selection method for an impor-
tant type of public ofﬁcial, local government executives, on
policy choices and to investigate underlying mechanisms.

Previous literature on the selection method for local exec-
utives focuses on U.S. municipalities, where two main forms

1 This is also supported by empirical studies that show that policy choices
are affected by selection and incentives of ofﬁceholders due to term lim-
its (Alt, Bueno de Mesquita, & Rose, 2011; Besley & Case, 1995; List &
Sturm, 2006) and the type of electoral rule (e.g., proportional versus plural-
ity rule) that is applied (Funk & Gathmann, 2013; Gagliarducci, Nannicini,
& Naticchioni, 2011; Persson and Tabellini, 2003).

of government exist: the council-manager system (the man-
ager is appointed by the city council) and the mayor-council
system (the mayor is elected by voters).2 The majority of
these studies use municipal spending in one or two U.S.
states as the outcome variable. The results are mixed: some
ﬁnd that mayor-council cities spend more than council-
manager cities (Booms, 1966; Lineberry & Fowler, 1967),
while others reach the opposite conclusion (Clark, 1968;
Coate & Knight, 2011; Sherbenou, 1961) or ﬁnd no effect
(MacDonald, 2008). A limited number of studies focus
on other outcome variables. Levin and Tadelis (2010) ﬁnd
that privatizations take place more often in council-manager
cities than in mayor-council cities. Vlaicu and Whalley
(2016) are the ﬁrst to consider political cycles: elected may-
ors hire more police ofﬁcers in election years to please
voters who value security. This is not the case in cities with
appointed mayors. Enikolopov (2014) focuses on patronage
as a tool for targeted redistribution and provides evidence
that the number of public employees is larger in mayor-
council cities than in council-manager cities, especially in
election years.3

Although the literature on mayor-council and council-
manager cities offers compelling results regarding the impor-
tance of the selection rule for policy choices, it has to
confront a number of empirical difﬁculties. First, citizens
in U.S. municipalities can choose their form of government
in a local referendum that may give rise to reverse causality.4
A second issue is cotreatment: managers and mayors in the
United States differ not only in the way they are selected.
Managers are typically nonpartisan bureaucrats required to
have a professional background in public administration.
Mayors are professional politicians endowed with more for-
mal powers to inﬂuence policy decisions than managers.5 A
third difﬁculty is measurement error: ofﬁcial information on

2 According to Enikolopov (2014), two-thirds of all U.S. cities can be clas-
siﬁed into these two types. The remaining ones are cities with commission,
town meeting, or representative town meeting forms of government, as well
as counties with commission form of government.

3 Besides these studies on the form of local government, there is also
a related literature on the selection method for ofﬁcials in other areas of
the public sector. Choi, Gulati, and Posner (2008) show that while elected
judges write more opinions than appointed ones, their opinions tend to be
of lower quality (see also Iaryczower, Lewis, & Shum, 2013, and Lim,
2013). Besley and Coate (2003) ﬁnd that elected regulators choose more
pro-consumer-friendly policies than appointed ones. Other public ofﬁcials
for whom selection rules have been explored are school superintendents
(Partridge & Sass, 2011) and city treasurers (Whalley, 2013).

4 One notable attempt to address endogeneity is the use of precipitation
shocks as an instrument for changes in the form of government (Vlaicu &
Whalley, 2016).

5 The two main forms of government in the United States may also differ in
other respects, as any detail can be changed in a local referendum. Recently,
many council-manager cities have also selected a mayor who serves on the
council but has less political inﬂuence than a mayor in a mayor-council city.

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

the form of government in U.S. cities is not available. The
studies therefore rely on administrative surveys, which have
been shown to provide diverging classiﬁcations for some
municipalities, in turn leading to contradictory empirical
results (Coate & Knight, 2011).6

In this paper, I exploit a quasi-experiment at the level
of German municipalities to study the effect of the selec-
tion rule for mayors on their policy choices. Following a
statewide referendum in 1991, municipalities in the German
state of Hesse switched from mayor appointment to direct
mayor elections between 1993 and 1998. The end of the
term of the last appointed mayor varies across municipali-
ties for exogenous historical reasons that are orthogonal to
municipality characteristics. This randomization determines
the timing of the switch in a particular municipality. At the
same time, the reform did not change the balance of power
and responsibilities between the mayor and the local coun-
cil. Finally, ofﬁcial information on how mayors are selected
is available for all municipalities in each year of the sample
period.7

This paper makes three substantive contributions to the
literature. First, the reliance on a natural experiment and the
availability of administrative data on the mayor selection rule
in a given municipality and year allow me to identify the
causal effect of direct elections on mayors’ policy choices.
Speciﬁcally, these features allow me to circumvent the three
problems in the existing literature on the form of govern-
ment reviewed above (reverse causality, cotreatment, and
measurement error). A second contribution of my study is
that I use a new outcome variable to analyze policy choices.
U.S. studies use municipal spending and public employment
as the outcome variable. I use investment grant receipts for
several reasons. First, a municipality may receive a grant for
an investment project if and only if a detailed application

6 While measurement error may seem like a minor issue at ﬁrst sight,
studies indicate that estimates for the relationship between the form of
government and public spending depend decisively on the accuracy of clas-
siﬁcations for the form of government. MacDonald (2008) and Coate and
Knight (2011) use a similar sample and estimation techniques but reach
different conclusions: MacDonald (2008) ﬁnds no differences, while Coate
and Knight (2011) ﬁnd that spending is higher in council-manager cities.
Coate and Knight (2011) explain this as follows: “The differences appear to
be driven by differences in the switching measure used. While MacDonald
used a measure based upon comparison of reported government form across
survey years, we use a more conservative measure based upon a reported
change in form of government” (p. 105).

7 I am not the ﬁrst to analyze reforms of mayor selection in Germany.
Previous studies investigate the effect of presidentialism/parliamentarism
or the use of the plurality/proportional rule on ﬁscal outcomes at the local
level. Blume, Doering, and Voigt (2008) ﬁnd that when mayors are elected,
local spending and revenues decline in municipalities in Schleswig-Holstein
and converge toward municipalities in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where mayors
have always been elected. Since expenditures are aggregated at the state
level, however, the observed effects cannot be disentangled from state-
speciﬁc effects. Ade (2013) focuses on three German states and provides
evidence that tax rates are lower and public spending is higher in cities
with elected mayors. Egger, Koethenbuerger, and Smart (2007) analyze the
introduction of mayor elections in Lower Saxony, which was accompanied
by a large increase in the power and responsibilities of mayors. This reform
therefore resembles a move from the U.S.-style council-manager system
to the mayor-council system. The authors ﬁnd that redistributive spending
increases with mayor elections.

is prepared and submitted by its mayor. Therefore, grant
receipts directly depend on mayors’ effort and competence,
and mayors can claim exclusive credit for grant receipts.
This is supported by anecdotal evidence that mayors utilize
their success in attracting investment grants in their electoral
campaign via the local media.8 On the other hand, spending
and police hiring are not under the direct control of may-
ors in my context. Second, investment grants are restricted
to public projects that happen to be highly visible to voters
(e.g., day care facilities, road construction). A third contri-
bution is that I combine ofﬁcial election and ﬁscal data at
the municipality level with hand-collected information on
individual mayors. Data on mayor appointments (e.g., dates,
identities of mayors, party afﬁliations) are not available from
an ofﬁcial source. Similarly, there is no ofﬁcial information
on the education level, occupational background, and age
of elected or appointed mayors. This unique combination of
data allows me to investigate transmission channels.

Political agency models provide a useful theoretical back-
ground to think about the effect of the selection rule for
mayors on investment grant receipts. First, mayors may have
stronger incentives to perform well when they are elected.
Given that voters can oust them from ofﬁce if they perform
poorly, elected mayors may be less susceptible to moral haz-
ard and exert more effort to attract transfers (Barro, 1973;
Ferejohn, 1986). Direct elections may also incentivize may-
ors to signal their competence to voters prior to an election.
Following Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and Rogoff (1990), such
incentives would lead to political budget cycles in investment
grants. Second, elected mayors may attract more transfers
because they have different characteristics than appointed
mayors do. If the preelectoral signaling as modeled in Rogoff
and Sibert (1988) and Rogoff (1990) is effective, candidates
elected into ofﬁce may be more competent and therefore
more efﬁcacious in attracting additional grants even if incen-
tives had not changed. More generally, the candidate pool
may be endogenous to the selection method for the mayor’s
ofﬁce, and voters may be more likely to select competent
mayors than party ofﬁcials (Besley, 2005).

In line with these theoretical considerations, I ﬁnd that in
an election year, elected mayors attract on average 7% to
7.4% more investment grants for their municipality from the
state government. For appointed mayors, there is no cycle.9

8 One example is an article in a local newspaper, “Mayor Election in
Langen—Frieder Gebhardt Starts the Electoral Campaign,” December 7,
2013. The mayor strategically mentions his success in attracting invest-
ment grants and lists several infrastructure projects: “When he looks back
on his six years in ofﬁce, he thinks: ‘It is great what we managed to
get done.’ Examples are the successful town hall project, the reconstruc-
tion of the gymnasium . . ., the reconstruction of a child care facility
and the construction of an additional childcare facility” (http://www.op
-online.de/lokales/nachrichten/langen/buergermeisterwahl-langen
-frieder-gebhardt-spd-eroeffnet-wahlkampf-3259423.html).

9 This paper also contributes to an emerging empirical literature on polit-
ical budget cycles that are conditional on institutional features at the level
of subnational governments (Aidt & Mooney, 2014; Aidt, Veiga, & Veiga,
2011; Akhmedov & Zhuravskaya, 2004; Sjahrir, Kis-Katos, & Schulze,
2013).

ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCENTIVES OF APPOINTED AND ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICIALS

53

Using hand-collected data on mayor characteristics, I also
present suggestive evidence for electoral incentives rather
than selection as a more relevant explanation for the cycle
in my setting. First, the estimate for the cycle in investment
grants hardly changes when I control for mayor character-
istics. Second, I show that for the subset of mayors who
were in ofﬁce in both regimes, the estimate is similar to the
baseline estimate.

Three extensions to the baseline speciﬁcation validate my
main ﬁndings. First, I show that when only considering elec-
tions that take place late in a year, the increase in investment
grants in election years is as high as 11%. Second, the last
cohort of appointed mayors that faced a direct election for
the ﬁrst time was particularly motivated to attract transfers,
presumably due to the expectation that voters prefer different
types of mayors. In the year of the ﬁrst direct elections, the
increase in investment grant receipts amounts to about 10%.
Third, I provide further evidence that electoral incentives
are mainly responsible for the cycle by exploring the issue
of divided government. Electoral incentives of mayors are
likely lower under divided government because voters may
be less likely to attribute investment grant receipts only to
the mayor. A council dominated by opposition parties may
try to claim credit for any additional grants. Conversely, the
mayor may attempt to shift the blame to the council if she
fails to attract them. In line with this argument, I observe a
cycle only for the subset of elected mayors who do not face
a divided government.10

The ﬁndings in this paper are interesting not only because
they provide credible causal evidence that the selection
method for public ofﬁcials such as mayors affects policy
choices (internal validity), but also because the Hessian set-
ting has more general relevance (external validity). Many
other German states (and even countries such as Italy) have
recently replaced mayor appointments with mayor elections.
From a policy perspective, it is important to know whether
and how the switch has affected policy choices of mayors.
However, other settings are not as amenable to a causal anal-
ysis of this question. The switch to directly elected mayors
in other German states, for example, was typically accom-
panied by a change in mayors’ competencies. By isolating
the effect of the selection rule from other concurrent changes
to the responsibilities of the mayor, the results in this paper
allow us to better understand the speciﬁc implications of
various reforms to this public ofﬁce that typically happen
simultaneously.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
Section II discusses the theoretical background. Section
III provides information on the institutional background.
Section IV describes the empirical strategy and the data.
Section V reports the main estimation results. Section VI

10 One may also suspect that municipalities received extra funds from the
state tier when they switched to the new regime as compensation for reform-
related expenses. However, it is unlikely that such additional resources
would be channeled through the investment grants program. I am also not
aware of any such grants having been allocated.

presents the results for several extensions. Section VII
concludes.

II. Theory

Political agency models suggest

two mechanisms for
an effect of selection rules on policy choices: electoral
incentives and selection. This section reviews theoretical
contributions on these mechanisms to derive a prediction
on the effect of the selection rule for mayors on investment
grant receipts.11

In ﬁrst-generation political agency models, pioneered by
Barro (1973) and Ferejohn (1986), elections motivate ofﬁce-
holders to exert effort on behalf of voters. For example, in
Ferejohn (1986) voters adopt a simple decision rule where
they reelect an incumbent only if her policy choices ensure a
level of utility that is above a certain threshold. The incum-
bent thus faces electoral incentives to exert sufﬁcient effort
to reach this level.

In second-generation agency models, such as Rogoff and
Sibert (1988) and Rogoff (1990), voters prefer to reelect
competent incumbents but cannot directly observe compe-
tence. They know, however, that competent incumbents are
more capable of temporarily manipulating ﬁscal variables.
Public ofﬁcials thus have an incentive to create political
budget cycles by choosing low tax rates or high public
expenditures before an election to signal their competence.
Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and Rogoff (1990) show that such
preelectoral manipulation can result in separating equilibria
where only competent ofﬁcials are retained by voters. Conse-
quently, elections may also affect policy choices by making
it more likely that competent candidates are selected into
ofﬁce.12

In view of this literature, it is plausible that a switch from
appointment to direct election leads to higher investment
grant receipts. First, elected mayors arguably have stronger
electoral incentives than appointed mayors. When mayors
are elected, the link between mayors’ policy choices and
their probability of reelection is immediate. Thus, elected
mayors face incentives to attract more transfers, in partic-
ular when an election is imminent. In contrast, voters can
hold appointed mayors accountable only in an indirect way.
When an appointed mayor performs poorly, voters can only
attempt to oust him from ofﬁce by voting in the next council
elections for a party that is opposed to the mayor. Yet in
council elections, voters cast their vote based on a broader

11 Note that an older literature in industrial organization suggests an
ambiguous prediction for this relationship. The argument there is that while
elected ofﬁcials are subject to a reelection constraint, appointed ofﬁcials
are subject to a comparable reappointment constraint. Thus, elected and
appointed ofﬁcials may face ultimately the same incentives and choose the
same policies to please the median voter (Baron, 1988; Deno & Mehay,
1987; Laffont, 1996).

12 That selection may affect policy choices is argued even more explic-
itly in citizen-candidate models on agency where voters elect candidates
according to their characteristics because voters anticipate that candidates
with certain characteristics are committed to speciﬁc policies (Osborne &
Slivinski, 1996; Besley & Coate, 1997).

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

set of policy outcomes (see section IIIA for more details on
the responsibilities of the council) and an appointed mayor
may therefore have smaller incentives to attract grants.13 Sec-
ond, the switch to direct elections may lead to an increase
in investment grants through the selection of mayors. The
introduction of mayor elections may induce a more compe-
tent breed of candidates to run for the mayor’s ofﬁce for the
following reasons: the personal characteristics of candidates
have become more salient, candidates are more exposed to
the public in a personalized election campaign, and elected
mayors are more likely to enjoy personal satisfaction from
attaining ofﬁce. In addition to the increase in average com-
petence in the candidate pool, direct elections may increase
the likelihood that more competent candidates are elected
into ofﬁce because voters might be more likely to choose
such candidates than party elites (Besley, 2005). Given that
elected mayors are on average more competent, it is possible
that elected mayors are more effective in attracting transfers
than appointed mayors are.

To summarize, elected mayors may attract more trans-
fers than appointed mayors because elections give rise to
stronger electoral incentives and a more competent selec-
tion of mayors. First-generation agency models predict that
transfers will be higher over the entire term. This prediction
also follows from second-generation models since elections
may lead to the selection of more competent ofﬁceholders.
Second-generation models also predict that grant receipts are
particularly high in election years.14

III.

Institutional Background

A. Municipalities, Mayors, and Local Public Finances

Hesse is among the more prosperous states in the Ger-
man federation and has been ruled by both left-wing and
right-wing governments. The population size of Hesse was
6.1 million at the end of 2012 (about 7.6% of the German
population). Hesse consists of 421 regular municipalities
and 5 exceptionally large municipalities that have a spe-
cial status and therefore assume both municipal and county
responsibilities.15

13 The policy choices of appointed mayors are more likely to be deter-
mined by nonelectoral career concerns (Alesina & Tabellini, 2007). For
an appointed mayor who wants to retain her position, for example, (par-
tisan) loyalty to the council majority may be more important than any
success in attracting grants. Alternatively, for an appointed mayor whose
career options include a possible switch to the private sector or a promotion
to higher ofﬁce, it may be more important to be perceived as a profes-
sional administrator who is able to ensure the smooth functioning of the
administration rather than helping the council majority get reelected.

14 Note that in Rogoff-type agency models of the rational political bud-
get cycle, electoral cycles are due to both selection and accountability
effects. Yet evidence for an electoral cycle could also be consistent with
an accountability-only agency model if voters are forgetful, as in Findley
(2015).

15 Since these ﬁve municipalities (Darmstadt, Frankfurt, Kassel, Offen-
bach, and Wiesbaden) are not comparable to the 421 regular municipalities
due to their special status, I exclude them from the empirical analysis.

Hessian municipalities provide their citizens with a num-
ber of goods and services, the provision of which is either
voluntary or compulsory. Compulsory provision includes
primary schooling, municipal day care services, and civil
protection. Voluntary provision includes swimming pools,
sports venues, and hospitals. Public provision of goods and
services at the municipal level is ﬁnanced with municipal
taxes, user fees, and transfers. In 2013, Hessian munici-
palities had 15.5 billion euros at their disposal. General
expenditures are ﬁnanced through taxes and transfers, while
user fees are charged for speciﬁc services. Transfers from
the state tier make up a large fraction of municipal rev-
enues. There are various transfer programs, which I describe
in section IIIC.

The municipal code of Hesse (Hessische Gemeindeord-
nung)—the magistrate constitution—stipulates that the local
council is in charge of key decisions and monitors the over-
all administration.16 The council can, however, hand over
some decisions to the mayor. The mayor usually works
full time and is supported by two individuals who work
in an honorary capacity. Together they form the magis-
trate.17 The mayor is present at council meetings and is
entitled to voice her opinion even though she does not have a
vote.

B. The Transition from Mayor Appointments

to Mayor Elections

The introduction of mayor elections in Hesse was a
rather unexpected reform that was strategically placed on
the agenda during an electoral campaign at the state level.
At the end of the 1980s, the Christian-Democratic pres-
ident of Hesse, Walter Wallmann, initiated parliamentary
deliberations that culminated in a referendum on the intro-
duction of mayor elections. This came as a surprise since this
reform was not popular with the ruling conservative-liberal
parties (CDU and FDP), but it was with left-wing parties.
Political observers have interpreted Wallmann’s move as a
strategic maneuver in the run-up to the state election on Jan-
uary 20, 1991. It is therefore also no coincidence that the
referendum took place on the same day as the state elec-
tion (von Arnim, 2002). Yet, not only was the referendum
unexpected; so was the popularity of this reform: 82% of
voters supported the reform. The relevant laws were ﬁnally
changed in May 1992. The reform was hence not based on
considerations to motivate mayors to exert more effort in
applying for state grants. It was simply a strategic maneuver
to win the support of a broader group of voters for the state
election.

For historical reasons, the introduction of mayor elec-
tions (and the start of the terms of the ﬁrst elected mayors)

16 The council is elected from party lists under a single-district propor-
tional election rule and is headed by an elected chairman, who presides
over council meetings.

17 The size of the magistrate is determined by the municipality itself.
Especially in large cities, there may be more than three magistrate members.

ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCENTIVES OF APPOINTED AND ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICIALS

was spread out between 1993 and 1998.18 Two important
sources of this variation are the initial asynchronous dates for
mayor appointments in 1946 and 1947 and municipal merger
reforms in the 1970s. According to the Hessian municipal
code (§42, HGO), the appointment or election of a mayor has
to take place three to six months before the incumbent steps
down.19 Hence, some of the variation is due to the auton-
omy that municipalities have in choosing the date within
this three-month window and the way in which the dates are
shifted further and further apart over the decades. Another
reason is that some mayors have not served a full term often
for reasons beyond their control (death, sickness, retirement,
or dismissal by the council).20 After the last appointed mayor
in a municipality had completed her six-year term, the ﬁrst
directly elected mayor took ofﬁce.

The introduction of mayor elections has not affected the
division of formal powers and responsibilities. The reform
has, however, removed the dependence of the mayor on the
local council. This independence also comes at a cost for the
incumbent mayor. When running for reelection, the incum-
bent mayor can no longer rely on the entrenched majority of
her party in the council.21

While the role of mayors is mostly limited to the exe-
cution of council decisions (see section IIIA), the reform
of mayor selection is nevertheless likely to have affected
policy outcomes in Hessian municipalities. As I describe in
section IIIC, mayors are responsible for the preparation and
submission of applications for state investment grants. They
can submit these applications without permission by the
council.22

This paper focuses on Hessian municipalities for two rea-
sons that make Hesse a compelling setting to study the effects

18 The ﬁrst mayor elections took place on May 2, 1993, in Alsfeld, Borken,
Gudensberg, Lauterbach, Ottrau, and Waldems. The last municipality that
held its ﬁrst mayor election was Melsungen on November 8, 1998.

19 If a term ends prematurely for unforeseen reasons, it has to take place

within four months.

20 To give an example, the ﬁrst mayor of Hanau (Karl Rehbein) was
appointed twice by the local council but died after ten years in ofﬁce, two
years ahead of the end of his second term. The second mayor (Heinrich
Fischer) served a full term of six years. The third mayor of Hanau (Herbert
Dröse) was elected twice into ofﬁce but retired in the middle of his second
term. The fourth mayor of Hanau (Hans Martin) served two full terms. After-
ward, Helmut Kuhn was in ofﬁce for only about sixteen months before he
was dismissed by the local council. Finally, Hans Martin was elected again
into ofﬁce two times before retiring three years ahead of the end of his last
term.

21 Before the reform, the mayor was appointed by the local council via
a two-thirds majority vote. The council was able to remove the appointed
mayor from ofﬁce if it wished to do so. Since the reform, the mayor is elected
by the people. If no candidate receives an absolute majority of votes, a run-
off election takes place with the two most successful candidates of the ﬁrst
round running against each other. Note that turnout in council elections has
decreased from an average of 78% in the prereform period to 61% in the
postreform period, which indicates that the introduction of mayor elections
may have given rise to some degree of voter fatigue.

22 Given this particular role of mayors in Hesse, using other outcome
variables such as municipal tax rates and spending or even nondiscretionary
outcomes such as rule-based transfer receipts can serve to further validate
my estimation results for investment grants via placebo tests. In online
appendix B, I provide estimation results showing that none of the other
ﬁscal outcomes are affected by the reform of mayor selection.

of the selection method for mayors on policy choices.23 First,
the powers and responsibilities of Hessian mayors were not
changed by the reform. This is different in other German
states that later introduced mayor elections. A second advan-
tage is that the timing of the switch varies across Hessian
municipalities for exogenous historical reasons. These two
unique features allow for a clean identiﬁcation.

C. Allocation of Investment Grants

The German constitution requires that citizens have some
minimum living standard regardless of where they live.24
Within each German state, this principle is reﬂected by
a municipal equalization scheme (Kommunaler Finanzaus-
gleich). These schemes require that the state government
provides poorer municipalities and municipalities that face
a higher burden of public provision of goods and services
with the necessary ﬁnancial means.

The ﬁrst step in the municipal equalization scheme is the
determination of the total amount of resources to be allo-
cated, which varies from year to year. It equals 23% of the
state government’s total revenues from the income tax, the
corporate tax, the sales tax, the wealth tax, the motor vehicle
tax, the property acquisition tax, and the apportionment of
the business tax, plus any additional resources that the state
government may wish to add. In 2013, the state government
allocated 3.8 billion euros by the municipal equalization
scheme.

More than half of these resources are allocated to
Hessian municipalities via general-purpose grants (Schlüs-
selzuweisungen), which are allocated according to speciﬁc
rules that into account the ﬁscal need and the ﬁscal capacity
of each municipality. The ﬁscal capacity measure reﬂects the
hypothetical tax-raising potential of a municipality, while
the ﬁscal need measure is a function of a municipality’s
population size.25

Special-purpose grants (besondere Finanzzuweisungen)
differ from general-purpose grants since they are tied to
a particular purpose (e.g., schooling, day care facilities,

23 The reform in Hesse had an impact on West German local politics
beyond the boundaries of Hesse. Other German states where mayors had
traditionally been appointed followed suit after the Hessian reform. Only
in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg had mayors always been elected since
World War II. Mayor elections were introduced in Rhineland-Palatinate in
1993, North-Rhine Westphalia and Saarland in 1994, Schleswig-Holstein
in 1995, and Lower-Saxony in 1996.

24 This is not explicitly stated in the constitution, but various provisions
are usually interpreted accordingly. Speciﬁcally, Article 72, §2 of the Basic
Law in its current wording states that the federal government may adopt
legislation in a broad range of policy areas if such legislation is necessary
to ensure similar living conditions (gleichwertige Lebensverhältnisse) in
the federation. Article 106, §3.2 mentions similarity of living conditions
(Einheitlichkeit der Lebensverhältnisse) as one goal the federal revenue-
sharing scheme must strive to achieve.

25 When ﬁscal need exceeds ﬁscal capacity, a certain fraction of this dif-
ference is compensated with a grant that is allocated to the municipality
in question. Any shortfall of ﬁscal capacity below 80% of the ﬁscal need
measure is completely equalized. When ﬁscal capacity exceeds ﬁscal need,
a municipality nevertheless receives a minimum amount of general-purpose
grants. This minimum is a function of population size.

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

nursery schooling, youth welfare services, social welfare,
public transport, theaters, museums, libraries, music schools,
culture, road construction, health resorts). The allocation
of special-purpose grants in most cases follows a formula.
For example, schooling transfers depend on the number of
enrolled students, while road construction transfers are a pos-
itive function of the kilometers of roads that already exist
within a municipality’s boundaries.

Investment grants (Investitionszuweisungen) are tied not
only to a speciﬁc purpose but even to a particular invest-
ment project. The following types of projects are covered
by this grant scheme: hospitals, municipal drinking water
systems, municipal (hazardous) waste disposal, public trans-
port, municipal road construction, municipal child care
facilities, municipal elderly care facilities, habitat protec-
tion, municipal energy-saving measures, business-related
municipal infrastructure, village and city renewal, water pro-
tection, libraries, museums, music schools, sports facilities,
and municipal facilities for the disabled. In 2010, the Hessian
state government allocated 388 million euros as investment
grants.

Investment grants also differ from general-purpose and
special-purpose grants in a second important aspect: they are
allocated via an application procedure (Antrags- und Bewil-
ligungsverfahren).26 The type of the project determines to
which ministry the application has to be sent. For instance,
the Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for projects
regarding elderly care and hospitals, while the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, Trafﬁc, and Land Renewal is responsible
for projects that concern public transport or village renewal.
The procedure for the allocation of investment grants is
as follows. First, in the second half of the preceding year,
the state government disseminates a call for proposals for
each type of project via the state government gazette (Staat-
sanzeiger) and the responsible state ministries. Each call for
proposals provides information on the goals of the grant pro-
gram, details on which kinds of projects can be ﬁnanced, and
a list of required documents to support the application.27 The
call for proposals closes with an application form that has to
be completed and to which the supporting documents have
to be attached. This includes extensive documentation that
the project complies with a long list of funding guidelines.
Mayors are responsible for the preparation and submission
of the grant application packages. The responsible ministry
decides whether a project grant is approved based on whether
the project fulﬁlls the catalog of funding guidelines and
whether all other important information has been provided.
Generally, as long as the funding guidelines are fulﬁlled
and there are enough resources available, municipalities are

26 These grants cover a large share but not the full cost of a project. The
share of the project covered by the grant depends on the type of project and
the type of costs.

27 To give an example, in December 2012, a call for proposals published in
the Staatsanzeiger concerned projects on energy-efﬁcient refurbishments of
municipal buildings (Hessisches Ministerium für Umwelt, Energie, Land-
wirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz, 2012). The application form was eight
pages long, and at least seven supporting documents were required.

awarded the grant. The decision is usually taken by the
responsible ministry within a few weeks. In principle, it is
even possible that in the same year, a municipality is awarded
more than one grant by one of the ministries. The likelihood
that a grant is awarded is generally higher at the beginning
rather than the end of a year when, as is usually the case, all
resources are depleted. Yet if an application fulﬁlls all the
criteria but no resources are left over, the grant will simply
be awarded in the following year.28

Mayors who seek to be reelected have several ways in
which they can increase the likelihood that their municipal-
ity receives an investment grant. First, taking the trouble of
preparing and submitting an application is a necessary con-
dition for any grant receipt. Second, mayors should submit
the applications early rather than late in the year. Third, may-
ors should ensure the quality of the application (whether the
application is complete and fulﬁlls all funding guidelines).

IV. Empirical Strategy and Data

A. Empirical Strategy

I investigate whether elected mayors attract more invest-
ment grants from the state government
than appointed
mayors do. As argued in section II, elected mayors may
attract more grants because their electoral incentives are
larger or because they are more likely to have characteristics
that make them efﬁcacious in writing grant applications.

My estimations are based on a difference-in-differences
(DiD) approach. The reform divides the sample into pre-
and posttreatment periods, as well as treatment and control
groups. The identifying assumption for any DiD design is
that the outcome in the treatment and control group would
follow the same trend in the absence of treatment. This
assumption is usually veriﬁed by comparing the pretreatment
trends of the treatment and control groups.

Municipalities that introduced mayor elections in 1994
or later serve as the control group for the municipalities
that were treated in 1993. The control group for the other
annual cohorts is determined analogously. The identifying
assumption for my empirical design is therefore that all six
cohorts have parallel pretreatment trends in the outcome
variable (log of investment transfers per capita), which is
conﬁrmed by ﬁgure 1. As argued before, the timing of the
municipality-speciﬁc switch to mayor elections is due to
exogenous historical factors that are orthogonal to invest-
ment grant receipts. This natural randomization makes it
even more likely that the six cohorts are similar and provides
a reasonable approximation for counterfactual posttreatment
trends in the absence of treatment. The exogeneity in the
timing of treatment is further examined in section IVC.

I implement the DiD approach using the dummy variable
ElectedMayor that is 1 for a municipality as of the year

28 If a large multiyear project such as the construction of a hospital is
involved, the grant is paid in yearly installments conditional on the progress
of the project.

The 421 municipalities are divided into six cohorts according to the year in which a mayor was ﬁrst

when voters have elected their mayor for the ﬁrst time. The
baseline model is

yit = βElectedMayorit

+ αi + μt + Xγ + εit,

(1)

where y is the log of investment transfers per capita in
euros.29 Subscript i refers to one of the 421 municipalities,
and subscript t refers to a year in the sample period from
1982 to 2010. αi are municipality ﬁxed effects, and μt are
time ﬁxed effects. To obtain more precise estimates, I also
include a number of controls in some of the estimations. The
vector X includes demographic variables (log of population
size, share of 0–14-year-olds, share of over-65-year-olds) as
well as ﬁscal variables (log of rule-based transfers per capita,
municipality-speciﬁc tax rate multipliers for the business tax
rate and the tax rate for residential property).

While the speciﬁcation in equation (1) implies that the
effect is constant throughout a mayor’s term, it is plausible
that differences are particularly pronounced or signiﬁcant
in the years in which a mayor was selected, that is, in
an appointment or election year (see the discussion in
section II). My preferred speciﬁcation therefore addition-
ally includes a dummy variable that is 1 in each year
where a mayor was either appointed or elected (Elec-
tion/AppointmentYear) and interact this dummy with the
ElectedMayor dummy. The estimation equation looks as
follows:

29 There are 77 observations with transfers equal to 0. I follow the standard
approach in the literature and use log(investment transfers per capita + 1)
for all observations. There is generally no consensus on how to deal with
this problem. I have investigated the robustness of my results by instead
excluding the observations where investment grant receipts are equal to 0.
In these additional estimations (see table B.1 in online appendix B), the
coefﬁcient of the interaction term is slightly larger. As a second alternative,
I have conducted estimations with a level-speciﬁcation excluding outliers
(available on request). The results are also qualitatively similar.

yit = βElectedMayorit

+ φElectedMayorit
+ Xγ + αi + μt + εit.

+ δElection/AppointmentYearit
× Election/AppointmentYearit

(2)

All hypothesis tests use heteroskedasticity-robust stan-
dard errors. Bertrand, Duﬂo, and Mullainathan (2004) show
that autocorrelation is a substantial concern for the DiD
approach. Therefore, in all of my estimations, the standard
errors are clustered at the level of the 421 municipalities.
Some estimations also include county-speciﬁc time trends
to capture systematic variation over time in a more ﬂexible
manner.30

While the above speciﬁcations allow me to test whether
policy choices of mayors depend on the selection rule,
any differences may be due to either incentive or selection
effects. To discriminate between these two channels, I adopt
two strategies. First, I add mayor characteristics as covariates
to equation (2) and estimate the following model:

yit = βElectedMayorit

+ φElectedMayorit
+ Xγ + Zω + αi + μt + εit,

+ δElection/AppointmentYearit
× Election/AppointmentYearit

(3)

where Z is a vector of mayor characteristics such as age,
gender, or educational background. Any effect of direct elec-
tions on policy choices due to a different selection of mayors
should be accounted for by these additional covariates. The
estimates for the cycle can then be interpreted as the residual
effect of larger electoral incentives.

As a second strategy, I restrict the sample used to esti-
mate equation (2) to the set of mayors who were in ofﬁce
under both the appointment and the election system. As the
underlying characteristics of these mayors have remained
constant, any change in investment grant receipts can be
plausibly ascribed to changes in electoral incentives. While
a caveat to this approach is that this subsample of may-
ors is (self-)selected, these estimates can provide further
suggestive evidence on the relative importance of electoral
incentives and selection.31

B. Data

Ofﬁcial data. The source for ofﬁcial information on
mayor elections and ﬁscal variables is the Statistical Ofﬁce
of Hesse. This includes a data set on mayor elections in all
421 municipalities since 1993. The data set provides infor-
mation on the names, gender, and party afﬁliations of all
candidates; the number of valid votes per candidate; and the
election date. The Statistical Ofﬁce also provides data on the

30 In online appendix B, I present additional estimations with county-

speciﬁc time dummies. The results are similar.

31 Speciﬁcally, even if the sample is (self-)selected, any observed differ-
ences in policy choices in this subset of mayors cannot be due to selection
based on fundamental personal characteristics as gender, educational
background, or prior professional career.

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

amount of investment grants per capita in euros that a munic-
ipality has received from the state government in a certain
year. I use these data as the dependent variable in my estima-
tions. Finally, I have obtained data from the Statistical Ofﬁce
on a number of ﬁscal and demographic variables. Summary
statistics are provided in table A.1 in online appendix A.

Hand-collected data. The data provided by the Statisti-
cal Ofﬁce are not sufﬁcient to conduct the empirical analysis
as described in section IVA. In particular, data on mayor
appointments (names, gender, party afﬁliations of mayors,
appointment dates) and mayor characteristics (dates of birth,
education levels, and ﬁelds of occupation) are not avail-
able from an ofﬁcial source. I have hand-collected these two
missing types of data from various Internet sources such
as municipality websites, mayors’ personal websites, and e-
mail communication with the mayors or their administrative
assistants and employees of the municipal archives. The data
collection for this unique data set took place between Sep-
tember 2013 and March 2014. The hand-collected data cover
81.3% of the sample (9,926 out of 12,209 municipality-year
observations).

Table A.3 in online appendix A collects descriptive evi-
dence on changes in mayor characteristics over time. The
t-tests provide evidence that there are some signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in mayor characteristics: elected mayors are more
likely to have a degree from a higher education institution,
they have studied other subjects at the university, they have
a different professional background, they are more likely to
be independent candidates, they are more often women, and
they are older.32

C. Exogenous Timing of First Mayor Elections

A closer look at the data suggests that the timing of the
municipality-speciﬁc switch to mayor elections is indeed
quasi-random. There are in particular three pieces of evi-
dence. First, table 1 describes the timing of the introduction
of mayor elections in the 421 municipalities between 1993
and 1998. The ﬁrst mayor elections are distributed quite
evenly over these six years as the quasi-experimental nature
of the reform would suggest. Second, ﬁgure A.1 in online
appendix A illustrates that the six reform cohorts are not
geographically clustered.33 Third, if this is a true natural
experiment, the six reform cohorts should not differ in terms
of predetermined characteristics. I have collected data on
ten variables that describe the ﬁscal stance, the demographic
structure, public employment, and the size of municipal-
ities. For each characteristic, I calculate averages for the
year 1992 and conduct two-group mean-comparison t-tests

32 I also ﬁnd that direct elections have likely led to a different selection
of mayors by studying incumbency effects. The incumbency advantage of
mayors declines after the reform, which indicates that voters prefer differ-
ent types of candidates than party elites do. These results are available on
request.

33 This excludes imitation of neighboring municipalities that elected their

mayor as one motive for self-selection into one of the six cohorts.

for all possible pairs among the six cohorts. Table A.2 in
online appendix A summarizes the results. While there are
more signiﬁcant differences than would be expected by pure
chance, a large majority of the pairwise comparisons are
insigniﬁcant. Moreover, there is no systematic pattern in the
few signiﬁcant t-tests, suggesting, for example, that later
cohorts are systematically more or less likely to exhibit
certain characteristics.

those that still retain an appointed mayor (dashed line) and
those that have introduced mayor elections (solid line). The
dashed line covers the time period 1982 to 1997 and the

is substantial variation over time in grant receipts. One rea-
son is, as pointed out in section IIIC, that the amount of
resources available for the allocation of grants depends on

the tax revenues that the state government collects in a partic-
ular year, which in turn is highly dependent on the business
cycle.

Independent of trends in average investment grants, during
the phase-in period, the solid line is always above the dashed
line: municipalities with elected mayors receive on average
more investment grants than municipalities with appointed
mayors do. Despite the fact that the composition of the two
groups of municipalities changes over time as municipali-
ties gradually elect a mayor for the ﬁrst time, the distance
between the two lines is fairly constant. This pattern addi-
tionally conﬁrms the quasi-random timing in the switch to
mayor elections, as discussed in section IVC.

B. Baseline Results

Table 2 collects the results for DiD regressions that relate
a dummy for the mayor selection scheme to investment
transfer receipts (see equation [1]). Model I includes only
a dummy for the selection scheme. Model II adds county-
speciﬁc time trends. Model III additionally includes control
variables. The estimated coefﬁcient for the Elected Mayor
dummy is insigniﬁcant in all three models: there are no
signiﬁcant differences in grant receipts.

One reason that the coefﬁcient is not signiﬁcant is possi-
bly that elected mayors attract higher transfers only when
a mayor election is about to take place—in the election
year itself. To explore this possibility, I compare transfer
receipts in mayor election years with transfer receipts in
mayor appointment years. Table 3 has the same structure
as table 2. The only difference is that two additional vari-
ables are included: the Election/Appointment Year dummy
and its interaction with the Elected Mayor dummy (see
Equation [2]).

The estimated coefﬁcient for the interaction term in all
three models is signiﬁcant at the 5% level. Transfer receipts
are on average 7% to 7.4% higher in mayor election years
compared to mayor appointment years. That is, I observe
a cycle only in the new regime. In view of my results in
table 2, this implies that the switch from appointments to
elections has induced a shift in the timing of grant receipts

but has not led to higher grant receipts in general. The 7% to
7.4% difference amounts to about 42,300 to 44,700 euros for
an average Hessian municipality with about 10,000 inhab-
itants.34 This absolute increase is not overwhelming, but it
is sufﬁciently large to for voters notice. Various additional
projects can be realized with such amounts.35

C. Electoral Incentives and Selection

The estimates reported in section VB suggest

that
while transfers do not differ signiﬁcantly in nonelec-
tion/appointment years, they differ signiﬁcantly in elec-
tion/appointment years. While these results are consistent
with the political agency framework, it remains unclear
whether the cycle after the switch to direct elections emerges
because of incentive or selection effects.

As discussed in section IVA, I pursue two strategies
to explore this question. First, I report in table 4 regres-
sions where I control for observable mayor characteristics as
speciﬁed in equation (3). With this speciﬁcation, I analyze
whether the inclusion of mayor characteristics as covariates
affects the size of the coefﬁcient for the interaction term
that captures differences in the electoral cycles. The data on
mayor characteristics cover 398 of the 421 Hessian munic-
ipalities (i.e., the sample size is slightly smaller than in the
baseline as it was not possible to collect data on mayor
characteristics for the full sample of mayors).36

34 Average investment transfers per capita during the sample period were
60.39 euros. Hence, a 7% to 7.4% increase in transfers equals an absolute
increase of 4.23 to 4.47 euros per capita.

35 Examples: refurbishment of public day care facilities in Gross-
Gerau (28,000 euros) and Biebertal (17,000 euros), city renewal mea-
sures in Grossenlüder (19,000 euros). See http://www.ruesselsheimer

36 A problem with the drop in sample size may be that this attrition is
systematically related to the timing of the switch in a municipality. I have
explored this issue and ﬁnd that attrition is not concentrated in a particular
cohort.

The dependent variable is the log of investment transfers per capita. Standard errors in parentheses
are robust to heteroskedasticity and clustered at the municipality level. Control variables include share of
population over 65 years, share of population below 15 years, log of population size, log of rule-based
transfers per capita, and business and property tax rate multipliers.

I ﬁrst rerun the baseline regression without any covariates
but with the smaller sample as a benchmark. The results are
collected in model I of table 4. The estimate in this model
is 6.4%, slightly smaller than the baseline estimate of 7.0%
to 7.4%, and insigniﬁcant. Models II to V successively add
the education level, the professional background, the gender
and age, and the party afﬁliation of mayors as covariates.
The coefﬁcients remain at the same order of magnitude
as in model I. While the drop in the number of obser-
vations is problematic insofar as the coefﬁcient becomes
insigniﬁcant ( p-value = 0.12), the results in table 4 overall
provide suggestive evidence that the cycle in grant receipts
for elected mayors is due to electoral incentives rather than
selection.

The second strategy to discriminate between selection and
incentive effects is to restrict the sample to mayors who
were facing both an election and appointment while in ofﬁce.
This reduced sample covers 124 of 421 municipalities. By
considering this subsample, I test whether the same person
has responded differently to an imminent appointment or
election. The estimates reported in table 5 are not signiﬁ-
cant given the smaller sample and the consequently larger

standard errors. Yet the coefﬁcients have about the same
magnitude as in the baseline estimations (7.3% instead of
7.4% in model III). These results provide additional sugges-
tive evidence that the cycle in investment grants observed in
the baseline regressions is more likely to be due to higher
electoral incentives of elected mayors rather than changes in
their characteristics.

VI. Robustness and Validation

In the following, I explore the robustness of the base-
line results and validate further that the cycle observed in
the baseline regressions is primarily due to larger electoral
incentives.37

A. Timing of the Election

As discussed in section IIIC, mayors typically submit the
application and, if successful, receive the investment grant
in the same year. Yet if an election is held early in the year,
mayors likely have smaller incentives to submit an applica-
tion as a grant may not be approved in time to help them
win the election. The estimates in table 3 are thus possibly
a lower bound: investment grant receipts in an election year
may be higher when the election is held later in the year.

Models I to III in table 6 explore this issue. I redeﬁne
the election dummy (and consequently also the interaction
with the dummy for direct elections) such that it is 0 if the
election is held in January or February (model I), between
January and April (model II), and between January and June
(model III). Thus, I deﬁne only years where the election was
held relatively late as election years (and treat election years
where the election was held early as nonelection years).

The coefﬁcient estimates in models I to III conﬁrm that the
baseline results are likely lower bounds. The estimates are
positive, statistically signiﬁcant, and of a larger magnitude

37 I report four additional robustness tests (exclusion of nonpositive trans-
fers, inclusion of lagged dependent variable, inclusion of county-speciﬁc
time ﬁxed effects, and placebo tests with other ﬁscal outcomes) in online
appendix B.

than in the baseline regressions. Furthermore, the magnitude
of the coefﬁcients is consistently larger the later the consid-
ered elections are in the year. For elections held between July
and December, I estimate an increase in grants of about 11%.
If an election is held early in the year, it is plausible that
mayors are already trying to acquire additional grants in the
preelection or appointment year. Not accounting for this may
also lead me to underestimate the importance of the cycle.
I hence investigate the timing of grant receipts further by
exploring whether there are signiﬁcant differences in elec-
toral cycles across the two regimes one year ahead of an
election or appointment. I deﬁne the dummy variable Elec-
tion/appointment year −1 and interact it with the Elected
Mayor dummy.

Model IV of table 6 collects the estimation results. The
estimates suggest that one year ahead of a mayor elec-
tion, there are no signiﬁcant differences in grant receipts
compared to one year ahead of a mayor appointment. This
generally suggests that elected mayors increase their efforts
in attracting grants as close as possible to the election day.
Successfully attracting investment grants in a preelection
year may in fact be of little use for a mayor even for elec-
tions that are held early in the next year. Since the grants are
awarded on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-serve basis, waiting until the
last few months of a preelection year likely decreases the
chances that the grant will be approved in time (see section
IIIC). On the other hand, successfully attracting grants too
early in a preelection year may not make a difference in the
election if voters have a short memory.

their competence to voters before the ﬁrst direct elections.
On the one hand, the last cohort of appointed mayors may
have expected to be ousted from ofﬁce by voters no matter
what because voters prefer a different type of mayor (e.g.,
a more charismatic type). Anticipating that no amount of
investment grants would convince voters to retain them in
ofﬁce, they may have ceased to exert any effort to attract
grants. I would underestimate the effect of the switch to
direct elections on investment grant receipts if this type of
anticipation effect is not accounted for (as these mayors were
still in ofﬁce when the ﬁrst direct elections took place).

On the other hand, the last cohort of appointed mayors
may have believed that there was some chance that they
would be elected even if voters in principle would prefer a
different type of mayor than party ofﬁcials would. In this
case, the last cohort of appointed mayors may have exerted
even more effort to attract additional grants before the ﬁrst
direct elections to overcome their perceived disadvantage
due to the change in the selection rule.

I explore this theoretically ambiguous issue in table 7 by
distinguishing between the ﬁrst mayor elections after the
switch and all subsequent elections. I ﬁnd that the increase in
investment transfers is larger in the ﬁrst than in subsequent
election years (10.1% versus 6.5% in model III), suggest-
ing that anticipation effects may have especially (but not
exclusively) led the last cohort of appointed mayors to exert
additional effort in the election year. These results further
underline that electoral incentives matter for mayors’ policy
choices.

B. Anticipation Effects

C. Divided Government

One further consideration is that

the last cohort of
appointed mayors may have had either particularly small
or particularly large incentives to perform well and to signal

Another important extension to consider is the issue of
divided government—the possibility that the council major-
ity and the mayor belong to different ideological camps.

The dependent variable is the log of investment transfers per capita. Standard errors are robust to het-
eroskedasticity and clustered at the municipality level (reported in parentheses). Control variables include
share of population over 65 years, share of population below 15 years, log of population size, log of rule-
based transfers per capita, and business and property tax rate multipliers. Signiﬁcant at *10%, **5%, and
***1%.

Appointed mayors typically have by default the support of
the council. While divided government was generally pos-
sible even before the switch (because council elections took
place every four years and mayors were appointed every
six years), any misalignment between the mayor’s politi-
cal camp and the council majority was temporary. After the
introduction of mayor elections, divided government became
both more likely and more persistent since the mayor could
remain in ofﬁce without the support of the council majority
as long as she was reelected by the voters.

Existing evidence indicates that electoral accountabil-
ity is lower under divided government (Lowry, Alt, &
Ferree, 1998), presumably because voters ﬁnd it difﬁcult
to accurately attribute responsibility for policy choices to
the various branches of the government. In line with this, it
is possible that elected mayors have electoral incentives to
attract higher transfers in election years only when there is no
divided government. The reason is that elected mayors may
anticipate that a substantial fraction of voters attributes any
failure to attract additional grants to the opposition council
majority and mayors may therefore exert less effort. Alterna-
tively, elected mayors may be concerned that an opposition
council majority will claim some of the credit for additional
grants.

Figure A.2 in online appendix A shows how the share of
municipalities with divided governments has evolved over
the sample period. As expected, there has been a discontin-
uous increase in the share of divided governments in 1993
from about 40% to more than 55%.38 In this ﬁgure, divided
government is deﬁned as a misalignment between the polit-
ical camp of the mayor and the political camp of the council
majority. I consider three political camps: a left-wing camp
consisting of the SPD, and Green Party, a right-wing camp
consisting of the CDU and the FDP, and an independent

38 Note that I do not know the party afﬁliation of all mayors, especially
at the beginning of the sample period. I drop observations with missing
information when constructing the ﬁgure.

camp consisting of all other parties.39 A municipality is con-
sidered to be subject to divided government if a left-wing
mayor faces a council with no left-wing majority, a right-
wing major faces a council with no right-wing majority, and
an independent mayor faces a council with a nonindependent
majority.

As a next step, I investigate how the increased propen-
sity for divided government matters for grant receipts. The
hypothesis is that the switch to mayor elections led to larger
electoral cycles only in municipalities that were not sub-
ject to divided government. I explore this hypothesis by
estimating the baseline model for subsamples restricted to
municipality-year pairs with and without divided govern-
ments, respectively. In models I to III in table 8, I reestimate
the baseline models for the nondivided government subsam-
ple. I ﬁnd a signiﬁcant 12% increase in investment grants in
election years, which is substantially larger than the 7% to
7.4% increase in the baseline regressions. In models IV to VI,
I replicate the baseline regressions for the divided govern-
ment subsample and ﬁnd that the switch to direct elections
did not lead to electoral cycles in this subset of municipali-
ties. Overall, these additional results show that the strength
of electoral incentives has a decisive inﬂuence on how the
reform of the mayor selection rule affects investment grant
receipts.

VII. Conclusion

A prominent theoretical literature on political agency sug-
gests that the way in which public ofﬁcials are selected
matters for their policy choices. My study is the ﬁrst to
identify the causal effect of the selection method on may-
ors’ policy choices and to differentiate between incentive
and selection effects. In particular, I use the unique setting
provided through a reform of mayor selection in a German
state to investigate whether policy choices differ when may-
ors are appointed by a local council or directly elected by
voters.

I ﬁnd that elected mayors attract on average 7% to 7.4%
more investment grants from the state tier in election years.
Robustness tests indicate that this estimate is likely a lower
bound. For appointed mayors, there is no cycle. I pro-
vide suggestive evidence that this cycle emerges because
of stronger electoral incentives.

In view of my results, should mayors be elected or
appointed? On the one hand, my results may imply that may-
ors should be elected. First, the ﬁnding that elected mayors
exert more effort than appointed mayors to attract invest-
ment transfers in election years suggests that there may be
some beneﬁt for their municipalities. Second, the switch to

39 It is reasonable to focus on political blocs rather than parties. First,
almost all left-wing mayors are from the SPD, while almost all right-wing
mayors are from the CDU. Second, while there are no explicit coalitions at
the local level, it is plausible that the parties within the ideological camps
cooperate when necessary. Note also that the ﬁgures on the incidence of
divided government and the regression results are similar when I deﬁne
divided governments based on individual parties rather than party blocs.

The dependent variable is the log of investment transfers per capita. Standard errors in parentheses are robust to heteroskedasticity and clustered at the municipality level. Control variables include share of population

over 65 years, share of population below 15 years, log of population size, log of rule-based transfers per capita, and business and property tax rate multipliers. Signiﬁcant at *10%, **5%, and ***1%.

direct elections, while distorting the timing of effort, may
have improved the match between the investment needs of
municipalities and transfer receipts. It is possible that elected
mayors in municipalities that are most in need of investment
grants attract more transfers because they expect particularly
large electoral rewards.

On the other hand, my results may imply that mayors
should be appointed. First, I ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences
in transfer receipts over the entire term, which suggests that
elections do not cause elected mayors to exert more effort in
general. One could argue that such a distortion in the tim-
ing of grant receipts may diminish welfare because citizens
would prefer a steady ﬂow of investment projects. Second,
even if elections led to more grants in general (and not only in
election years), it is not necessarily the case that writing grant
applications is the best use of mayors’ time. Mayors could
pursue other activities that would possibly be more beneﬁ-
cial but less visible to voters. Electoral incentives may thus
lead public ofﬁcials to reallocate their efforts from produc-
tive but invisible to less productive but visible tasks, and it is
not clear that such a shift is necessarily welfare improving.
While the welfare implications are ambiguous in my
context, the ﬁndings in this paper conﬁrm that selection
rules affect public ofﬁcials’ incentives and policy choices.
That elections ostensibly lead mayors to exert more effort
suggests that direct elections may increase voters’ wel-
fare provided that the local constitution is appropriately
designed. Mayor elections are more likely to have positive
welfare implications if there is a clear link between the pol-
icy domains over which mayors have authority and voters’
welfare.
