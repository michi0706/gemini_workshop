This study examines the effect of abolishing user fees from the maternal and child health (MCH) services on child
quantity and quality in South Africa in the post-apartheid era. Exploiting exogenous variation in exposure to the
policy effect, we ﬁnd that the policy resulted in lower fertility in households and greater educational attainment of
children a decade later. The absence of the effects among children not subject to the policy eliminates channels
through heterogeneous preexisting trends or unobserved concurrent changes. The important policy implications
are (i) the theoretical predictions of the child quantity-quality tradeoff model characterize reproductive behavior
among parents in developing countries; and (ii) MCH policy serves as a motivating force underlying the de-
mographic transition and human capital development.

1. Introduction

Universal access to high-quality maternal and child health (MCH)
care remains as one of the most critical policy issues in low income
countries. Despite the worldwide efforts to improve MCH as targeted by
the Millennium Development Goals, progress is insufﬁcient and key de-
terminants of MCH remains unaddressed in many settings, resulting in
estimated 5.9 million child deaths under age ﬁve, primarily during in-
fancy, from readily preventable and treatable diseases and estimated
303,000 maternal deaths during pregnancy and childbirth in 2015
(UNICEF, 2015; WHO, 2015).

In this study, we examine the effect of one of the largest scale MCH
policy reforms on child quality and quantity (QQ). Namely, we focus on
the abolition of user fees from healthcare services for pregnant mothers
and children under 6 years old in the aftermath of the dismantlement of
apartheid in 1994 in South Africa. The present study investigates the

effects a decade later of that earlier removal of user fees on educational
outcomes and fertility decisions. We ﬁnd that abolishing user fees from
health services led to reduced fertility in households and increased
educational attainment of children with a great extent of the policy
exposure between 1993 and 2004. We conduct the robustness checks and
falsiﬁcation tests that show the absence of the treatment effects on both
child QQ among the cohorts not subject to the health policy, which
eliminate potentially confounding channels such as heterogeneities in
preexisting trends and post-reform bias arising from educational and
other social reforms.

This study contributes to two distinct strands of the literature. First,
our study presents new evidence of the effects of MCH interventions over
an extended period. The MCH policy we focus on is the removal of user
fees from health services.1 Assessing the beneﬁts of free health services is
important in its own right, as there is an increasing interest among
development economists and policymakers in the question of whether

1 Other MCH interventions include the Matlab Health and Family Planning Program. Launched in 1977 in a rural area of Bangladesh, the program initially emphasized family planning
services such as home delivery of contraceptives, and later added extensive maternal and child health services. See, for example, Canning and Shultz (2012), Joshi and Schultz (2013), and
Foster and Milusheva (2014) for various program effects.

user fees should be charged or abolished from basic health services.2
While a growing number of African countries have recently begun to
remove user fees, such policies remain controversial due to a perceived
tradeoff between the two opposing views – while charging even small
fees is evidenced for substantially lowering take-ups, user fees have been
widely adopted as a means of generating revenues vital for providing
quality services as well as targeting individuals in need of a good and
increase usage thereof. The introduction of such policies at the national
level renders a rigorous assessment difﬁcult. On the one hand, the esti-
mated effects are likely to be overstated by unobserved time factors
(Lagarde and Palmer, 2008), while on the other hand, estimates will
prove to be substantially understated if short-run improvements in uti-
lization and health status continue to beneﬁt other dimensions, such as
child quantity and quality, over an extended period of time. To date,
there is few convincing quantitative evidence assessing the effect of MCH
services on educational attainment.

The analysis in this study overcomes such shortcomings in the liter-
ature by exploiting salient features of South Africa's history of apartheid
to establish causality. For more than four decades up to 1994, blacks in
South Africa had limited political representation as well as limited ability
to choose their place of residence. The control exercised by whites over
the allocation of health resources, unrelated to the demand of black Af-
ricans for these resources, resulted in little correlation between initial
availability of health facilities and household characteristics across
communities. This not only limits the scope of heterogeneous preexisting
trends but also provides us with plausibly exogenous variation in the
policy exposure. Using a similar research design, a previous study by
Tanaka (2014) shows that the removal of user fees in South Africa in
1994 led to substantial improvements in nutritional status among chil-
dren in communities with a health facility relative to those without, in
the period between 1993 and 1998.

Second, this study presents empirical evidence to assess the theoret-
ical prediction of the QQ tradeoff model. Economists have long been
interested in explaining the historical demographic shift from high to low
fertility rates. The stylized fact that this demographic transition has
almost always been coupled with human capital development and eco-
nomic growth has given rise to the theoretical conjecture of a tradeoff
between QQ (Becker, 1960; and Becker and Lewis, 1973; Becker and
Tomes, 1976; Hanushek, 1992; Galor and Weil, 2000; Kalemli-Ozcan,
2002, 2003; Tamura, 2006).

A number of economic theories have attributed the decline in fertility
to historical changes in factors raising the opportunity costs of a marginal
child, namely the price of child quantity, due, for instance, to increased
adult wages (Becker et al., 1990; Hazan and Berdugo, 2002), or elevated
women's status (Mincer, 1963; Galor and Weil, 1996; Lagerl€of, 2003).
Empirical evidence regarding the interaction between quantity and
quality has also predominantly concentrated on research contexts
involving constraints on the quantity of children, i.e., using exogenous
changes in the number of children parents choose to have due to unex-
pected incidences, such as twin births or same-gender siblings (Rose-
nzweig and Wolpin, 1980; Angrist and Evans, 1998; Angrist et al, 2005;
Black et al., 2005; Rosenzweig and Zhang 2009) or economic incentives
for child-bearing, such as changes in relative female wages (Schultz,
1985, 1986) or ﬁnancial support for obstetric care (Boyer, 1989; Whit-
tington et al., 1990; Zhang et al., 1994; Acs, 1996; Kearney, 2004; Mil-
ligan, 2005; Laroque and Salanie, 2008; Cohen et al., 2013).

We identify a speciﬁc health policy as the trigger for the demographic
transition. The MCH policy is likely to affect prices of both child quality
and quantity. On the one hand, increased price of child quantity due to,
for instance, increased access to family planning and contraceptive
methods leads to a fertility reduction. On the other hand, increased ef-
ﬁciency in learning in an environment where low health status had been
a major impediment to learning in school effectively lowers the price of
quality investments, which in turn induces parents to invest more in
human capital and reduce fertility. We know of no other study that ex-
ploits a health care policy as a motivating factor underlying such fertility
and human capital development process.

In addition, there has been little empirical investigation regarding the
fertility response to relaxing constraints on the quality of children. For
example, Galor and Weil (2000) develop a uniﬁed endogenous growth
model, in which increased returns to education due to technological
progress are followed by reductions in fertility and increases in human
capital investment. However, empirical evidence focusing on the fertility
response to the quality shock is scarce, except for Bleakley and Lange
(2009) and Aaronson et al. (2014).3 These studies focus on the U.S.
settings, and it remains unaddressed as to the extent to which, or even
whether, fertility can be portrayed as a matter of parental choice among
poor households in developing countries, who are likely to confront
different constraints such as high fertility rates, inadequate access to
health services, and low health status to begin with. Our ﬁndings hold
important implications for fertility behavior among parents in devel-
oping countries by demonstrating that appropriate economic incentives
can induce demographic transition, obviating the necessity of resorting
to intense population policies to curb fertility growth.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 de-
scribes the historical background of health policy and education in South
Africa and the effect of new health policy on nutritional status among
children. Section 3 illustrates the conceptual framework that highlights
the key mechanisms, through which the MCH policy affects fertility and
educational attainment via its impacts on the prices of child quantity and
quality investments. Section 4 describes the dataset used in the main
analysis, its summary statistics as initial evidence, an econometric
framework, and discusses the validity of its identiﬁcation assumptions.
Section 5 reports empirical results from the main and falsiﬁcation/
robustness analyses, and Section 6 explores and tests additional alter-
native hypotheses. Section 7 concludes.

2. Background

2.1. History of health policy and education in South Africa

Apartheid in South Africa has an enduring legacy as one of the most
discriminatory regimes in modern history. In a society characterized by
extreme racial segregation, black Africans constituted the poorest and
most underserved group, suffering the greatest oppression by whites in
all aspects of their lives. For the purpose of our research context, two
salient features of that regime were: restricted residential choice and
unequal allocation of resources among black African communities.

The Bantu Authorities Act of 1951 conﬁned black Africans within
impoverished so-called “homelands,” not only externally determining
their place of residence but also prohibiting them from freely migrating
within the country. Further, the white minority in urban areas controlled
almost all resources without representation from the black majority. As a
consequence, few resources were allocated to black African communities,

2 Whether free distribution or cost-sharing achieves an efﬁcient allocation of basic
health goods has recently been debated. Recent evidence, primarily derived from ran-
domized controlled trials, suggests that charging even a small price substantially reduces
usage of health goods (i.e., insecticide-treated nets, deworming drugs, or water disinfec-
tant), due in large part to resultant crowding out of the poor in need of these goods
(Kremer and Miguel, 2007; Holla and Kremer, 2009; Cohen and Dupas, 2010; Ashraf et al.,
2010; J-PAL, 2011). These studies lend strong support to free distribution of health goods
over cost-sharing as a way to enhance equity in access to health goods and services and to
improve health status.

3 Bleakley and Lange (2009) consider the hookworm eradication in the U.S. as the
increased return to child quality when the burden of the disease considerably depressed
the returns to learning. Along with the ﬁndings in Bleakley (2007), they show that a
fertility decline was at the root of substantial improvements in school attendance and
literacy a decade after the intervention took place. Also, Aaronson et al. (2014) show a
smaller number of children along the intensive margin in response to greater schooling
opportunities for children.

and the meager resources thus allocated were distributed in a quasi-
random fashion unrelated to local demand. Under these circumstances,
the overriding issue among children was the disparity and inequality in
nutritional status and educational performance across
races and
geographical areas.

With respect to health, the absence of coordination and integration
among as many as eighteen central and regional departments of health
resulted in unequal distribution of health resources across and within
provinces. In addition, there was neither a comprehensive health policy
nor a central institution to coordinate health plans and practices at the
national level. As a result, black Africans suffered from substantially low
health status due to poor access to health services, constrained by costly
out-of-pocket payments for health services as well as by a dearth of fa-
cilities, doctors, and medicines in the public health sector.

The new democratic government established in 1994 undertook
immediate efforts to ensure equal access to public services. The most
remarkable policy in the health sector was the abolition of user fees
from healthcare services to pregnant women and to children under 6
years of age at public health facilities such as hospitals and clinics.
These services included pre- and post-natal services until 42 days after
delivery as well as primary care services to children, such as maternal
nutrition, breastfeeding assistance, nutrition education, child immuni-
zation, growth monitoring, nutritional promotion, and micronutrient
supplementation.

Among black Africans, for whom the cost of medical services had
been a major impediment to accessing treatment, the abolition of user
fees contributed to substantial increases in the utilization of health fa-
cilities among pregnant women and children under 6 years of age
(McCoy, 1996; Department of Health, 1998; Schneider and Gilson, 1999;
Wilkinson et al., 2001; Cooper et al., 2004; Morestin and Ridde, 2009).
For instance, the ﬁndings by a national household survey conducted in
1993 by the Community Agency for Social Enquiry (CASE) (1995) indi-
cate that “not affordable” is the most common reason given by black
families for foregoing health care (73.8%), followed by lack of trans-
portation (11.5%). In contrast, only 23.2% of whites listed cost as a
primary barrier. Further, 90% of black Africans had no health insurance
in contrast with 24% of whites without any insurance.

In the educational sector, on the other hand, progress in eliminating
racial disparities was more limited, despite signiﬁcant efforts to equalize
the allocation of government funds. Two facts are especially important
for our research purpose. First, most black Africans continued to perform
poorly in school due in large part to differences in school resources, fees,
and curricula that began under apartheid (Fiske and Ladd, 2004;
Yamauchi, 2005; van der Berg, 2007; van der Berg and Louw, 2007;
Bhorat and Oosthuizen, 2008). Although the demise of apartheid freed
black African students from severe restrictions on school choice, most
remained in schools with poor infrastructure (Lam et al., 2011). This
averts endogenous sorting of black African students across schools,
creating little correlation between household characteristics (e.g., the
income and educational background of parents) and the quality of
schools their children attended (Case and Deaton, 1999).

Second, the degree of variation in student performance remains high,
even after controlling for household and school characteristics (Case and
Deaton, 1999; Crouch and Mabogoane, 1998, 2001; Hoadley, 2007; van
der Berg, 2007; Bhorat and Oosthuizen, 2008; van der Berg and Shep-
herd, 2008), a phenomenon which Lam et al. (2011) call “schooling as a

attributes in relation to educational performance leaves the identiﬁcation

4 There are several possible explanations for such variation. On the one hand, Hoadley
(2007) points to the frequently chaotic classroom environment as well as ineffective
classroom and school management, and on the other hand, van der Berg and Shepherd
(2008) attribute the problem to poor internal assessment of student performance. Lam et
al. (2011) establish a model with evidence to support the claim that a stochastic linkage
between actual ability and measured performance has led to high enrollment and high
repetition rates among black African schools.

of key factors contributing to better educational performance an
open question.

2.2. Free healthcare services and nutritional improvements among children

Access to health services is one of the most important contributors to
nutritional status, particularly among poor black African children who
were not previously reached by such services.5 Tanaka (2014) provides
three important ﬁndings for our present research context. First, he ﬁnds
that the abolition of user fees from health services led to immediate and
substantial improvements in nutritional status among newborns between
1994 and 1998, allowing us to exploit such nutritional improvements as a
shock to price of child quality investments. Second, he identiﬁes the
source of variation in health improvements as plausibly exogenous,
namely variation in infrastructure across communities under apartheid.
We present similar evidence below that household characteristics are
ex-ante similar, reﬂecting the historical fact that infrastructure was pre-
dominantly controlled by whites unrelated to demand by black Africans.
Third, these improvements in health status were not concentrated on the
lower tail of the health status distribution, indicating that the mean shift
in health status was not entirely due to shrinkage of the low health status
cohort. The important implication is that free healthcare does not appear
to have contributed to mortality reductions, ruling out a mechanism
through which fertility reductions responded to the likelihood of child
survival. We investigate the effect on mortality in greater detail in Online
Appendix II.

3. Conceptual framework

Originating with Becker and Lewis (1973), the parental utility func-
tion typically considers child quantity, n, and quality, q, in which parents
decide the optimal n and q simultaneously:
Max U ¼ Uðn; q; xÞ;
where ∂U=∂k > 0, ∂2U=∂k2 < 0 for k ¼ ðn; q; xÞ and x is a set of other goods
and services, subject to the budget constraint:
I  πnn þ πqnq þ x

where I is the household income, πnn represents ﬁxed expenditures on
child quantity that is independent of child quality, and πqnq represents
costs of quality investments into children (with the standard assumption
that child quality is identical across children within family).
The equilibrium conditions at ðn*; q*Þ highlight the marginal costs, or

where λ denotes the marginal utility of income. These two equations
illustrate an important tradeoff between child quantity and quality. In
particular, the ﬁrst equation shows that an increase in child quality, q,
raises the marginal costs of having additional children, whereas the
second equation shows that an increase in the number of children, n,

5 Clearly another important contributor is the quality of medical services, including
factors such as the range of medical services, the availability of drugs and equipment, the
knowledge and skill levels of physicians and staff, and the quality of facilities. It is
important to note here that the importance of the quality of healthcare should not be
underestimated as the interactions between quantity and quality are key to promoting
further improvements in public health. However, we emphasize access, or the quantity-
side, more in a circumstance where prospective patients have poor access to begin with.
A small increase in the utilization of health facilities from virtually zero visits should result
in substantial improvements in health status whether we assume linearity or concavity in
the relationship between access and nutritional status.

35

raises the marginal costs of investing in child quality.

Most studies have focused on pathways from quantity to quality. For
example, reduced costs of contraceptive methods are associated with
increases in the marginal costs of child quantity, pn, which in turn de-
creases n, while the marginal costs of quality fall as n falls from the
second equilibrium condition, and thus the quality of children is upgra-
ded. Financial incentives to having additional children work in a similar
way: a decrease in marginal costs of child quantity increases n, and thus
increased marginal costs of quality will lead to lower quality of children.
The literature that exploits exogenous changes in the number of children
due, for instance, to multiple births, directly affects n, without referring
to changes in the marginal costs of child quantity, which then leads to an
increase in marginal costs of quality and thus a decrease in quality.

In contrast, changes in child quality can also affect quantity. For
instance,
improvements in health status are expected to improve
educational outcomes and lower barriers to investment in child quality
(in a typical environment where low health status is a major impediment
to learning). This effectively lowers the marginal costs of quality in-
vestments, pq, which should increase the level of such investment.
Increased investment in quality is associated with increased marginal
costs of quantity, as described in the ﬁrst equilibrium condition, and thus
fertility is expected to fall.6

4. Research design

4.1. Data sources

We use longitudinal datasets from the KwaZulu-Natal Income Dy-
namics Study (KIDS).7 KwaZulu-Natal province is the second largest
province in South Africa, representing approximately 20% of total pop-
ulation in 2011, the majority of whom are black Africans. Importantly,
KwaZulu-Natal province shares common attributes with other former
homelands, such as high rates of poverty and absence of basic services
(Klasen, 1997; Leibbrandt and Woolard, 1999; May et al., 2000).

We merge the ﬁrst wave in 1993 (hereafter KIDS93) and the third
wave in 2004 (hereafter KIDS04) to trace a-decade long adjustments. The
ﬁrst wave was conducted as part of the ﬁrst comprehensive national
household survey, the Project for Statistics and Living Standards and
Development, and thus it provides information prior to the new health
policy reform. The subsequent waves in the post-reform period revisited
only black Africans and Indians in KwaZulu-Natal province. Although the
second wave was conducted in 1998, the longer period of time between
the ﬁrst and the third waves enables us to trace children from early
childhood to primary school age. These datasets report detailed infor-
mation on key variables, including educational attainment and the
number of children, as well as other important individual and household
characteristics, such as age, gender, and education of all household
members. Moreover, we can link the household surveys to the commu-
nity surveys, which report infrastructure information, such as the number
and types of medical and public school facilities in communities.8

The sample used in the main analysis is restricted to black Africans
only in an effort to remove heterogeneities that may cause bias in our
estimates. This is appropriate as the goal of the health policy was to reach
out to disadvantaged groups, making black Africans particularly subject
to the effect of the policy.

6 Precisely speaking, fertility falls in response to increased educational return if child
to the cost of child quality (i.e., ∂n=∂pq > 0 if
quality is elastic with respect
½∂q=∂pq½pq=q <   1. Alternatively, the optimal number of children increases when the cost
of educating a child falls if ½∂q=∂pq½pq=q >   1). See Galor (2012) for the discussions.
7 For more detailed description of KIDS, see May et al. (2000), and May et al. (2007).
Also note that we use updated release version 2 of KIDS, which is free from some clusters
that suffered from data fabrication.

8 Throughout the paper, we use the term “community” to refer to a census enumerator
sub-district, the smallest geographical unit at which we can identify the health/education
facility information.

Notes: This table provides the numbers of health and educational facilities in the commu-
nities from KIDS93. The number of observations is 56. The high-treatment region indicates
the share of communities that had at least one clinic, dispensary, or hospital as of 1993.

4.2. Summary statistics

The baseline information regarding community-level infrastructure
as of 1993 is presented in Table 1. Observations are at the community
level. The ﬁrst column shows the types of facilities, the second column
the average number of each facility in the community, and the third
column its standard deviation.

Regarding the health facilities, there was either only one or zero fa-
cility for each type in each community in 1993, and thus the mean value
of clinics, for instance, indicates that 41% of communities had clinical
availability as well as 0.41 clinics existed on average per community. On
the other hand, dispensaries or hospitals barely existed in black African
communities. These observations are consistent with evidence that
clinics served as the main facility where black Africans received pre-natal
services and initial treatments. For our purposes, as discussed below, the
high-treatment region is deﬁned as communities with at least one clinic,
hospital, or dispensary; all other communities are deﬁned as the low-
treatment region. The last row indicates that 41% of the total 56 com-
munities (equivalent to 23 communities) constitute the high-treatment
region. Regarding the educational facilities, the table shows 1.86 pri-
mary schools and 0.82 secondary schools on average per community. It is
clear that
these communities lacked both educational and health
facilities.

Panel A of Table 2 presents summary statistics on variables used for
child quality analyses for the sample of black African children aged 7 to
14, using observations from KIDS93 and those from KIDS04 separately.
Note that those aged 14 or younger in 2004 were 4 years old or younger
in 1994 and thus had full exposure to free health services including a
prenatal period. We use educational attainment, that is, grade level
completed, to measure the parental investments in child quality. It is
worth noting that the use of educational attainment instead of years in
school avoids bias arising from grade repetition, which is highly preva-
lent among these students. Average educational attainment is about 3
years for cohorts of children with an average age of 10 years old in 1993,
whereas average educational attainment had increased to 3.8 years for
the same age group in 2004.

Panel B of Table 2 presents summary statistics on key variables for
child quantity for the sample of black African women aged 31 to 45, who
corresponds to the reproductive ages of 21 to 35 at the time of the policy
change. A comparison of children aged 8 or less between 1993 and 2004
measures the fertility dynamics in the post-reform period. We also pre-
sent children aged 11 to 19 to characterize a fertility trend in the pre-
reform period. On average, there were 0.95 children aged 8 or less and
1.25 children aged 11 to 19 per woman in 1993. Both of these ﬁgures had
fallen in 2004; there were 0.74 children and 1.06 children per woman,
respectively.9 The reduction in fertility even among cohorts born before

Notes: This table reports the number of observation, the mean, and the standard deviation of variables used in the child quality analysis (Panel A) and quantity analysis (Panel B). Ob-
servations are at the individual level. The sample in the quality analysis consists of children aged 7 to 14, and the sample in the quantity analysis consists of women aged 31 to 45.

1994 suggests that a simple comparison of fertility over time may
confound a preexisting time trend. We describe our econometric frame-
work that constructs a counterfactual and adequately controls for a time
trend below.

4.3. Econometric framework

Two important sources of variation constitute our empirical frame-
work to identify the effect of free health services on child quantity and
quality outcomes. First, user fees for health services were abolished in
1994, allowing us to observe pre-reform conditions from KIDS93 and to
observe outcomes a decade later in the post-reform period from KIDS04.
Second, although the policy was implemented simultaneously at the
national level, households in communities with existing health facilities
had greater intensity of exposure because they gained immediate access
to healthcare services, while those in communities without any health
facility had to travel long distances to receive treatment or wait until
facilities were built in their own communities.10 Thus, we deﬁne the
high-treatment region as communities where there was at least one
medical institution, in particular a clinic, hospital, or dispensary, in
1993.11 We use the interaction of these two variations in a reduced-form
equation of the difference-in-differences (DD) framework to measure the
effect of free health services on outcomes of interests.

10 Indeed, the government reported that the construction of health facilities in Kwazulu-
Natal province was slowed by political instability and violence (Cameron, 1996; Khan
et al., 2006), delaying even the ﬁrst democratic election until 1996. Such evidence sup-
ports our assertion that communities that did not have health facilities in 1993 continued
to have no health facilities for several years afterwards, creating variation in access to
healthcare services.
11 Other types of medical facilities include family planning clinics and maternity homes.
Access to these facilities may also explain exposure to the free health services. We present
in Online Appendix II the results using various alternative measures of the treatment.

individual and household characteristics.12 The community characteris-
tics (Wc) control for the numbers of primary and secondary schools, post
ofﬁces, banks, and regular markets; distances to each of these facilities;13
and (log of) population in 1993; all of which are interacted with the post
dummy, addressing the concern that there may be differential trends in
the outcome variable correlated with baseline community characteristics
in 1993. Additionally, we include the community ﬁxed effects, μc, which
help purge any time-invariant community characteristics, and birth-year
cohort ﬁxed effects, γk, to account for year-speciﬁc shocks common
across all individuals within a birth cohort. All standard errors are clus-
tered at the community level, allowing possible correlations over time
within communities.

The outcome of interest for the quality analysis is educational
attainment by child i aged between 7 and 14.14 In calculating educational
attainment, we focus on the number of years based on completed grades,
rather than the actual number of years in school, as the former should
most reﬂect educational performance or grade progression in an envi-
ronment where grade repetition is highly common.

The outcome of interest for the quantity analysis is the number of
children aged 8 or less that woman i had given birth to for the sample of
those aged 31–45 years old. Since the policy was reformed in 1994, these

12 For the quality analysis, the individual level of variables control for a female dummy
and a ﬁrst-born dummy, while the household level of variables includes mother's educa-
tion, mother's age, the average educational attainment among adult members, the number
of adult members, (log of) total monthly income, and dummies that indicate missing
values for each variable. The deﬁnition of “adult members” should be considered with
care. If siblings of our sample are included as adult members, adult members' education
may suffer from bias due to endogeneity, since there is a possibility that siblings' education
level and our outcomes (children's quantity and quality) are determined simultaneously.
To avoid this possibility, we deﬁne adult members as those over 30 years of age. For the
quantity analysis, the individual-level variables include educational attainment and the
household-level variables include the average educational attainment of adult household
members (aged 30 or above), the number of adult household members, (log of) total
monthly income, and dummies that indicate missing values for each variable.
13 Note that distance to a facility is asked only when there is no such facility in the
community, and thus we assign zero to distance when a facility sits in the community.
There are a few communities that do not report distance although no primary or secondary
school exists in the community. We include dummies that indicate missing values for these
cases. There is no such case for post ofﬁce, bank, or regular market.
14 These cohorts correspond to children in primary school and those in KIDS04 were not
old enough in 1994 to be ineligible to the free health services.

T. Ito, S. Tanaka

children from KIDS04 indicate post-reform fertility, whereas the same
age groups from KIDS93 provide analogous information in the pre-
reform period.15

To address the concern that the fertility variable might be biased by
child deaths for these age groups, two pieces of evidence are important.
First, Tanaka (2014) presents evidence that the relative increase in
nutritional improvements in the high-treatment region due to increased
access to health services is not concentrated on the lower tail of the
distribution. Instead, the reductions in the proportion of children with
extremely low nutritional status were similar between the two regions.
This is indeed not surprising because the services children obtained were
consultations or relatively simple treatments such as growth monitoring
and curative services upon being sick. These services were likely to have
affected the nutritional status among children while they are less likely to
have resulted in substantial reductions in mortality (which typically re-
sponds only to larger-scale interventions).16 Second, we present further
evidence in Online Appendix II that mortality reductions were similar
using available data.

The parameter of interest, α1, essentially measures the contribution of
free health services to the effects on child quality and quantity outcomes
across communities with distinct intensity of access to health facilities
and services (equivalently distinct exposure to the policy reform). The
estimated effects would be biased if there were unobserved heteroge-
neities across these communities that were correlated with the evolu-
tional path of the outcomes. We discuss the validity of such identiﬁcation
assumptions in the following subsection.

4.4. Validity of the identiﬁcation assumptions

The internal validity of our identiﬁcation strategy hinges on the
assumption that the availability of health facilities is plausibly exoge-
nously determined. This is less likely to hold in contexts where rich
households/communities can exert greater political power to bring in
more resources. South Africa under apartheid, however, provides a rare
case where this assumption is plausible because whites allocated re-
sources to black Africans' communities in a plausibly random manner,
over which black Africans had no control (Case and Deaton, 1999).17
Table 3 provides testable implications to support this assertion. We
conduct the balancing test to investigate the correlations between the
treatment status and various individual, household, and community
characteristics in the baseline sample from KIDS93.18 Signiﬁcant

15 Ideally, a precise history of childbirths and pregnancies over the 10-year period would
yield a more exact measurement of fertility. Because the pregnancy history questions in
both KIDS93 and KIDS04 do not report the year of pregnancy and suffer from low response
rates (about 21% of women did not answer the questions), we infer fertility using the
number of children aged 8 or less from the family roster.
16 Also note that Tanaka (2014) shows some decrease in nutritional status among older
children, i.e. those who were not entitled to free healthcare, due to declining quality of
services and the low morale of health providers. This suggests that little in the way of
technological advancements that could have affected all patients, regardless of age, took
place.
17 Case and Deaton (1999) present evidence that school quality, measured by
pupil-teacher ratios, which was extensively dispersed across black districts immediately
before the end of apartheid, is not associated with socioeconomic characteristics among
black families.
18 Note that we use the entire sample when conducting the balancing test. The use the
whole sample presents a better understanding of the overall community/households/in-
dividual characteristics. The purpose of Table 3 is to highlight the comparison of extensive
characteristics to test that high- and low-treatment communities are similar in the pre-
reform period. The use of the whole sample achieves the goal. We present analogous
evidence using only the sample used in the analysis (i.e., the sample of quantity analysis in
Panel B and the sample of quality analysis in Panel C) in Online Appendix I. The ﬁndings
are essentially the same. The only noticeable change we ﬁnd is that educational attain-
ment among boys is different between the high- and low-treatment regions and marginally
statistically signiﬁcant at the 10% level, yet the point estimate suggests that, if anything,
educational attainment was higher in the low-treatment region in 1993, and thus the bias,
if any, goes against our ﬁnding of increased educational attainment in the high-treatment
region.

differences in characteristics may lead to severe bias in our analysis, as
they indicate that the two types of regions were distinct.

As it turns out, we ﬁnd signal evidence that the treatment status
balances almost all baseline characteristics. Namely, there is no statistical
difference in: demographic characteristics among all individuals in the
dataset (years of educational attainment, age, and the ratio of female in
Panel A); quantity investments observed from parental characteristics
among women aged 20s–40s in their reproductive history (number of
pregnancies, number of births, number of births still alive, number of
their children dying before age 1, number of their children dying be-
tween aged 1 and 5 in Panel B); quality investments observed in educa-
tional attainment among children aged 7 to 15 for all children and
subdivided by gender in Panel C; household characteristics using all
households in the dataset (household size, dependency ratio, and
monthly income in Panel D); and community characteristics (the
numbers of primary schools, banks, and regular markets; distance mea-
sures to these facilities; except the numbers of secondary schools and post
ofﬁces and population, which will be addressed later, in Panel E).

Taken all together, these observations are consistent with the his-
torical fact that the existence of health facilities under apartheid was
based on an unknown, seemingly random rule determined by the white
minority and unrelated to local characteristics, including demand or
need, among black Africans. Therefore, these results provide no indica-
tion that unobserved heterogeneities would threaten the internal validity
of our econometric strategy.

5. Empirical results

5.1. Effect on child quality

We start by investigating the effect of the policy change on later
educational attainment for children aged 7 to 14. Panel A of Table 4
reports the estimated impacts on educational attainment. All speciﬁca-
tions include community and cohort ﬁxed effects. Column (1) presents
the basic framework without any additional covariates, while Column (2)
controls for the individual level variables (a female dummy and ﬁrst-born
dummy), and household level variables (mother's education, mother's
age, the average educational attainment among adult members, the
number of adult members, and (log of) total monthly income); and Col-
umn (3) additionally controls for initial community characteristics in
1993 (the numbers of primary/secondary schools, post ofﬁces, banks,
and regular markets in the community; distance to each of these facilities;
and (log of) population) interacted with the post dummy.19

The preferred estimate in Column (3) suggests that children in the
high-treatment region had completed 0.503 more years of schooling
than the corresponding cohorts in the low-treatment region.20 The
stability in the point estimates across extended control variables bol-
sters the view that the interaction term (“High  Post”) is not correlated
with changes in these variables. Although this is not a formal test of
exclusion restriction,
the absence of signiﬁcant correlation with
observable characteristics strongly suggests the absence of signiﬁcant
correlation with unobservable variables (Altonji et al., 2005). It is
worth noting that the point estimate increases after controlling for the
initial community characteristics, suggesting that the bias associated
with initial community characteristics, if any, goes against our ﬁnding.
This is indeed consistent with the fact that post-apartheid policies
focused on ensuring equality by allocating more resources
to
under-resourced communities.

In order to highlight factors that potentially contributed to increased
educational attainment, we examine changes in enrollment rate between
1993 and 2004. Table A1 shows that the mean enrollment rate in 1993

19 For each variable, we include a ﬂag that indicates the missing observations.
20 Educational attainment on average increased by 0.640 years in the low-treatment
region.

Notes: This table reports only the coefﬁcient of interest based on equation (1), using KIDS93
and KIDS04. In Panel A, we report the estimates from the quality analysis, in which the
dependent variable is educational attainment measured by the number of years of
completed education for the sample of children aged 7 to 14, whose age cohorts in KIDS04
were fully exposed to the new health policy. In Panel B, we report the estimates from the
quantity analysis, in which the dependent variable is the number of children aged 8 or less,
whose age cohorts in KIDS04 represent post-reform fertility, for the sample of women aged
31 to 45. All standard errors in the parentheses are clustered at the community level.

that changes in enrollment rates were similar between the high- and low-
treatment regions. This is not surprising in places like South Africa where
the enrollment rate is already high. Rather, repetition is known to be the
critical issue with attaining greater education among South African
children (Lam et al., 2011). We wished to compare changes in the
number of grades repeated before and after the policy reform, but such
information is available only in KIDS04. Thus, we test the mean differ-
ences between the high- and low-treatment regions in grade repetition in
2004. The estimate suggests that children in the high-treatment region
had a signiﬁcantly lower grade repetition. The evidence suggests, given
the similarity in other educational aspects in ex-ante characteristics, that
decreases in the number of grade repetition contributed to increased
educational attainment.

In what ways did parental investments in children's education in-
crease? To answer this question, we explore changes in parental expen-
ditures on education between 1993 and 2004. Table A2 suggests that
total educational expenditures incurred by the parents of our sample of
children increased by more than a third of the mean expenditures in
1993. Exploring speciﬁc items reveals that expenditures on stationary
and books and uniforms all increased signiﬁcantly. The increase in ex-
penditures on school fees was economically substantial, indicating nearly
a 65% increase, although the estimate is not statistically signiﬁcant. In
contrast, we ﬁnd negligible effect on expenditures on school meals and
transportation to school. The subtle changes in transportation expendi-
ture potentially reﬂect the ﬁnding (shown later) that physical access to

39

school did not systematically improve. Its important implication is that
educational attainment improved not due to variation in availability of
educational facilities, but rather due to, parental investments to oppor-
tunities for schooling and equipment to learn.

Overall, the ﬁnding is consistent with the predictions of the QQ
tradeoff model; parents in areas with improved access to free healthcare
increased their human capital investments in children.

5.2. Effect on child quantity

We now turn to the effect of the health policy reform on child
quantity. Panel B of Table 4 reports the coefﬁcient of interest, based on
the speciﬁcation in equation (1), using the number of children aged 8 or
less as the dependent variable for mothers aged 31 to 45. This variable
captures the overall fertility in the post-reform period between 1994
and 2004. All

ﬁxed effects.

speciﬁcations

include

Column (1) provides the estimate based on the basic speciﬁcation.
It shows that the introduction of free health services had a statistically
signiﬁcant negative impact on the number of children, indicating that
mothers in the high-treatment region had approximately 0.287 fewer
births relative to mothers in the low-treatment region over the
period.21 The estimate is robust in terms of controlling for variation
across individual and household characteristics in Column (2) and
initial community characteristics in Column (3).22 The preferred es-
timate in Column (3) suggests that the policy resulted in about a 32%
reduction in fertility.23 The stable point estimates across speciﬁcations
are again assuring the validity of our identiﬁcation assumption that
the treatment status is not associated with these key determinants of
child quantity.

It is also worth noting that our estimates of the policy impact on both
quality and quantity are likely to be understated if any, because our DD
estimates measure changes in the outcomes in the high-treatment region
relative to the low-treatment region, where children still had some
exposure to the policy. Thus, the estimates would be greater if we could
ﬁnd a pure control group among the same cohorts without any exposure
to the health policy.

5.3. Robustness checks on child quality effect

Studies intended to evaluate social policies often suffer from bias due
to two identiﬁcation issues: 1) that of inherent heterogeneities between
the treated and controlled groups, leading the controlled group to pro-
vide a false counterfactual for what would have happened to the treat-
ment group without an intervention; and/or 2) that of erroneously
picking up other effects through concurrent changes in society. In this
subsection, we conduct falsiﬁcation tests and robustness checks with
regard to the effects on child quality in an effort to explore these
possibilities.

Columns (1) and (2) of Table 5 Panel A report the results from the
falsiﬁcation tests on child quality investments, focusing on the sample of
children aged between 17 and 24 from KIDS93 and KIDS04. These co-
horts from KIDS04 were more than 6 years old in 1994, rendering them
ineligible for free health services. It turns out that none of the estimates is

21 Note that on average fertility fell by 0.126 in the low-treatment region.
22 Online Appendix II presents the fertility results using disaggregated age groups, which
shows the immediate declines in fertility after the policy change.
23 To put our estimate into the context, we compare our estimates to the effect of the
Matlab program in Bangladesh, a door-to-door outreach maternal and child health and
family planning program. The literature documents substantial reductions in fertility in
the outreach program villages since the program initiation. For instance, Joshi and Schultz
(2013) ﬁnd that women aged 35–54 years in the treated villages had on average 23%
fewer children than those living in the comparison areas did, among which women aged
45–49 achieved up to a 33% reduction. Phillips et al. (1982) also ﬁnd about a 25%
reduction in overall fertility by the program effect. Our estimated effect of 27%–32% is in
a similar range.

educational attainment measured by the number of years of completed education for the
sample of children aged 17 to 24 in Panel A and fertility measured by the number of
children aged 11 to 19 for women aged 42 to 56 in Panel B, both of which are not subject to
the health policy. In the robustness checks, the dependent variables and samples corre-
spond to those used in the main analysis for the young cohorts and those used in the
falsiﬁcation tests for the old cohorts. All standard errors in the parentheses are clustered at

statistically different from zero. This ﬁnding has several important
implications.

First, it suggests that parental behaviors with respect to investing in
children's education would have been similar in the two regions without
the health policy. Because even the observations from KIDS04 were not
granted free access to health services due to the age eligibility rule, these
estimates capture the evolution of human capital development among
cohorts not affected by the health policy reform. This helps preclude bias
arising from preexisting heterogeneities in education even without the
MCH policy change.

Second, it is important to keep in mind that the majority of these
cohorts from KIDS04 were in school in 1994 and thus were exposed to
various other changes, including educational reforms as described in
Section 2, in the post-reform period. Even though the health policy had
an impact on fertility, it is still possible that the changes in educational
outcomes were driven by these other concurrent changes. However, our
ﬁndings do not support such an assertion. The ﬁnding rather addresses a
bias arising from post-treatment heterogeneities in trends for cohorts
affected by concurrent changes.

Lastly, the ﬁnding rules out the externality effect of parents having
used some of the savings from reduced medical costs from their younger
siblings to pay for older siblings' school fees. The absence of such evi-
dence suggests that the income effect was negligible in our contexts.

As a further robustness check of accounting for pre- and post-
treatment bias, if any, in the falsiﬁcation tests in estimating the main
child quality effect, we employ a difference-in-differences-in-differences
(DDD) strategy, which essentially estimates the treatment effect of the
policy reform by directly removing community-speciﬁc trends using
counterfactual cohorts. The young cohort consists of the sample used in
the main analysis, and the old cohort, which provides counterfactual

40

trends, is the sample used in the falsiﬁcation tests.24 Column (3) uses the
interaction between the high-treatment dummy and post dummy, whereas
Column (4) uses the interaction between community dummies and the
post dummy to capture more precise variation across communities.25 The
parameter of interest is the coefﬁcient of the triple interaction between the
high-treatment, post, and young cohort dummies, which is interpreted as
the changes in the outcome variable among the young cohort after
adjusting community-speciﬁc trends using the old cohort.

The point estimate is slightly lower yet remain in the range of the
main results in Column (3), while it enlarges and becomes statistically
signiﬁcant at the 1% level in Column (4) when we capture variation
across communities by ﬁxed effects.

Overall, the ﬁndings on child quality in the main analysis are robust and
remain signiﬁcant even after adjusting for heterogeneous trends across
communities. Our evidence ﬁnds no indication that differential pre-existing
or post-treatment trends confound such results, but rather evidence shows
that the control group used in the main analysis serves as a valid comparison
group, providing strong support to our identiﬁcation strategy.

5.4. Robustness checks on child quantity effect

In this subsection, we conduct the similar analysis as above with
respect to child quantity effect. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 5 Panel B
investigate whether preexisting trends in the outcome variables across
communities confound the estimated effects on child quantity. The
dependent variable is the number of children aged 11 to 19 for the
sample of women aged 42 to 56. Because these children were all born
before 1994 (even the observations from KIDS04), any differences in the
estimates capture differential patterns in childbearing in the pre-reform
period between the two regions. Note that these women had children
aged 0 to 8 when they were 31–45 years old, thereby allowing an
appropriate comparison with women used in the main analysis. The re-
sults provide no evidence of statistical difference in fertility transition for
these women. Rather, the point estimates are consistently positive,
indicating that fertility was on a relatively increasing trend in the high-
treatment region before the policy reform, and thus the bias, if any,
goes against ﬁnding a reduction in fertility.

Columns (3) and (4) of Table 5 Panel B present robustness evidence
after directly controlling for pre-existing trends in the main analysis
based on the DDD strategy. We use children aged 0 to 8 for women aged
31 to 45 as the young cohort and children aged 11 to 19 for women aged
42 to 56 as the old cohort. The ﬁnding suggests that the point estimates
are nearly identical to the main results and remain statistically signiﬁ-
cant. Consistent with the ﬁnding in the falsiﬁcation test, the coefﬁcient of
the interaction between the high treatment dummy and post dummy
suggests that there is no differential trend among the old cohort.

Overall, the ﬁndings from the falsiﬁcation tests and robustness checks
leave little doubt that preexisting trends do not confound the main
ﬁndings, and that the signiﬁcant effects we ﬁnd in child quantity are
indeed due to increased access to free health services.

6. Alternative mechanisms

In this section, we explore various alternative pathways that may
account for the observed relationship between increased access to the
free MCH services, reduced fertility, and increased educational attain-
ment. Details are presented in Online Appendix III.

24 In particular, the counterfactual cohorts considered here are children aged 17 to 24
from KIDS93 and KIDS04. These cohorts present counterfactual evidence in terms of pre-
treatment bias in education for cohorts not affected by the health policy as well as post-
treatment bias in education for cohorts affected by concurrent changes in social pol-
icies. The young cohorts are children aged 7 to 14. These cohorts observed in KIDS04 are
all fully exposed to the new health policy.
25 We additionally interact all characteristics and ﬁxed effects with the young cohort
dummies to allow for their differential effects between the old and young cohorts.

6.1. Does an educational reform explain increased educational
attainment?

The falsiﬁcation test above has already demonstrated no improvement
in educational attainment among cohorts who were not subject to the
health policy yet were subject to any reforms in the educational system,
thereby refuting the role of educational reforms to explain observed im-
provements in educational attainment. Here we consider additional pos-
sibilities that the high-treatment region received more investments in
education in the post-reform period, if these places were seen as more
politically important or based on some other unknown factor that led to the
establishment of health facilities in the ﬁrst place. In particular, we
examine i) the coefﬁcients of the interaction term between initial school
infrastructure and the post-reform dummy, ii) changes in school infra-
structure between KIDS93 and KIDS98, and iii) quality improvements in
educational services. The evidence consistently suggests that the high-
treatment region was no more beneﬁted from educational reforms than
the low-treatment region. The ﬁnding is consistent with Lam et al. (2011)
who show limited improvements in the educational sector.

6.2. Did any other policies affect price of child quantity?

There were two welfare programs operant during this period. The old-
age pension program was expanded for black Africans in the early 1990s.
Yet the program should not confound the main quality and quantity ef-
fects because we ﬁnd no similar fertility effects among cohorts born just
before 1994 or educational effects among cohorts not subject to the
health policy. The South African Child Support Grant started in 1998.
The program should not affect the cohorts born before 1998, for whom
we ﬁnd the fertility effects. Further, the program should induce higher
fertility to receive greater transfers, if any. Methodologically speaking, in
order for these programs to bias our estimates, their treatments would
have had to be correlated with the availability of health facilities, which
was not the case (Aguero et al., 2010; and Duﬂo, 2003). To the best of our
knowledge, there is no other policy that meets such a criterion and that
potentially affects the price of child quantity.

6.3. Does migration cause selection bias?

Migration was strictly regulated under apartheid, which provides one
of the salient features in our research setting that highlights similar
observed characteristics across communities in 1993.26 This does not,
however, preclude a possibility that people migrated in the post-
apartheid era. This might bias the main ﬁnding if households who
sought for better access to healthcare services also had preferences to-
ward low fertility and high child education.

We address bias arising from such self-selection via migration by
focusing only on the sample who have resided in the same community in
2004 since 1993. While the evidence conﬁrms that the main ﬁnding is
not driven by migrants, it also suggests that the actual impacts of the free
health services, as estimated by pure treatment and control groups
holding their residential locations ﬁxed, are likely to be greater than
what is estimated in the main analysis.

6.4. Does income effect explain fertility and educational outcomes?

Changes in the price of child quantity have been widely shown to
underlie demographic changes in various other settings. For example,
increases in relative female wages are shown to lower fertility through an
increase in the marginal costs of additional children. In our context, the
health policy is likely to have had a direct effect on mothers, as the health
policy targeted not only young children but also pregnant mothers. A

26 Although the legal restrictions on migration were relaxed in late 1980s, the costs of
migration remained high, resulting in little migration until 1994 (Dinkelman, 2017).

41

concern is that improvements in health among mothers may have inde-
pendent effects on both fertility and educational outcomes, causing a
spurious correlation between fertility and education. For example,
improved health status among mothers may lead to higher incomes or
better opportunities for employment, which raises opportunity costs of
child bearing, while income effect directly improves educational attain-
ment among children. While the evidence from the falsiﬁcation test has
already shown no quality effects among cohorts who should also be
beneﬁted from such income effects, we additionally tested and ﬁnd no
evidence that parental employment or income changed differentially
between the two types of the regions.

7. Conclusion

In this paper, we examine the effect of abolishing user fees from
health services on fertility and educational outcomes. We take advantage
of the unique history of South Africa to study a set of communities that
provide exogenous variation in the policy effect for individuals whose ex-
ante characteristics are otherwise similar.

By investigating the evolution of fertility and educational outcomes
among children who were entitled to free health services, we ﬁnd evidence
in support of the QQ tradeoff model: educational attainment improved, and
fertility fell. Our ﬁndings are robust across various speciﬁcations. In addi-

tion, we apply falsiﬁcation tests and explore alternative hypotheses to
preclude the possibilities that preexisting trends in fertility and educational
outcomes, educational reforms or other social policies, changes in parental
income, migration, and mortality reductions could confound our results.
These results pose an important policy implication for other devel-
oping countries contemplating the abolition of user fees, suggesting that
the beneﬁts of increased access to health services are not limited to
improved short-term health status, as described in Tanaka (2014), but
also extend to increased educational attainment and fertility reductions
over time. Reduced fertility and increased educational attainment are
considered to be two engines of economic growth, yet their causatio-
n–either one of them affecting the other or any third factor generating
both–remains an important question in the empirics of economic growth
and demographic transition. Our study highlights that the MCH policy
appears to be an effective mechanism for triggering the demographic
transition and human capital development, in the sense that parents,
even in developing countries, make rational fertility choices and educa-
tional investments, as predicted by the QQ tradeoff model. This ﬁnding
also discourages coercive population policies such as China's One Child
Policy, which can lead to adverse societal side effects. Our ﬁndings
suggest an alternative policy direction based on the fact that parents in
developing countries successfully alter and adjust their fertility behavior
in response to economic incentives.
